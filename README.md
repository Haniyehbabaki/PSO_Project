# Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Implementation

This project is part of the **Computational Intelligence course**.  
The goal is to implement the **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** algorithm to find the **minimum of the function**:

## 📘 Description

This project simulates a simple **PSO algorithm** that optimizes a two-dimensional function.  
Each particle explores the search space, updating its position and velocity based on:
- Its **personal best position**
- The **global best position** of the swarm
- The **inertia weight** and **acceleration coefficients**

## ⚙️ Parameters

| Parameter | Symbol | Value | Description |
|------------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Inertia weight | w | 0.5 | Controls momentum of the particle |
| Cognitive coefficient | c1 | 2.0 | Attraction to personal best |
| Social coefficient | c2 | 2.0 | Attraction to global best |
| Number of particles | N | 20 | Size of the swarm |
| Iterations | - | 50 | Number of iterations |
| Search space | x, y ∈ [-10, 10] | - | Boundaries for search |
